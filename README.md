### ✅ Next Steps for You:
- Replace all placeholders with your real links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).
- Add a `LICENSE` file if you haven't already (I can generate one for you).
- Deploy the site (e.g., on **GitHub Pages**) and update the live link.

Would you like me to generate a matching `LICENSE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` too?
